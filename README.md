# FFEM  
FFEM stands for Face Feature Embedding Module.  
This project includes following implementations:  
1. ArcFace  
2. GroupFace  
3. CenterLoss  

## Requirements
```
tensorflow>=2.19.0
numpy>=1.24.0
```

**Note**: This project has been updated to work with TensorFlow 2.19. The original version was developed for TensorFlow 2.4.1.

## Major Updates for TensorFlow 2.19
- Removed `tensorflow-addons` dependency and replaced with native TensorFlow operations
- Updated mixed precision API calls
- Fixed checkpoint restoration API
- Updated optimizer and callback implementations
- Replaced deprecated tensorflow_addons image operations with native TensorFlow equivalents

## How to Make Your Dataset
You have image_list.json file with the format (json) as below.  
```
{
  "Caucacian/a12/frontal1.jpg": {
    "label": 0,
    "x1": 9,
    "y1": 13,
    "x2": 75,
    "y2": 100
  },
  "Asian/p14/profile2.jpg": {
    "label": 0,
    "x1": 7,
    "y1": 7,
    "x2": 43,
    "y2": 65
  },
  ...
}
```
The `key` is a relative path of a face image.   
The `value` of the key contains label number and bounding box that indicates exact face location.  
The bounding box [x1, y1, x2, y2] is [left, top, right, bottom] respectively.  
We generated the bounding box using [[11]](https://github.com/blaueck/tf-mtcnn).  

## Transform the json file into TFRECORD
Input pipeline bottleneck increases training time.  
Reading data from a large file sequentially is better than reading a lot of small sized data randomly.  
Try the command below, it generates [name].tfrecord file from the above json file.  
```
python generate_tfrecord/main.py --root_path [path] --json_file [path] --output [name].tfrecord
```

## Common Settings
Execute the command `export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)` on linux and `$env:$PYTHONPATH=$pwd` on windows 10 powershell.  

## Recommendation Steps for Training.
1. Train a model with 'loss'=`SoftmaxCenter` on VGGFACE2 dataset.  
2. Train the pretrained model from first step with 'loss'=`AngularMargin` on large identity dataset.  
The training command is `python train/main.py`.

**RFW and VGGFACE2 are used for testing*  
**All models are pretrained on VGGFACE2 train-set*  
**Global Norm-Aware Pooling (GNAP) is used for pooling last spatial features of convolution layer.*
